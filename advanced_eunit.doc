== Advanced EUnit

=== Running Concurrent Tests

When you first start building tests in +EUnit+ they will in general
go really fast. Running your entire test suite will take a fraction of
a second and it will get run a lot. However as things progress more
tests will be added and each one will cause the suite to take a little
longer to run. At some point You will find that instead of taking 0.2
seconds to run your suite it will take long enough to annoy you. At
this point you might think that hey why not run each test in its own
process and have the whole thing take advantage of the fact that I
have a big fast computer with lots of cores, here is how to do it.
